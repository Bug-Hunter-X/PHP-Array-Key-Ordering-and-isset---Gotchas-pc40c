This repository demonstrates two common, yet easily overlooked, issues related to array handling in PHP. The first issue highlights the fact that PHP arrays do not guarantee numerical key order during iteration, while the second issue concerns the unexpected behavior of `isset()` when dealing with integer keys (particularly 0) and boolean keys like `false`.  The `bug.php` file contains examples of these issues. `bugSolution.php` provides possible ways to handle these scenarios.
